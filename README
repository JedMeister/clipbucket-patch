Adrian Moya's ClipBucket TKLPatch

"Hi! Do you want your own private youtube? you got it! This TKLPatch will convert Turnkey Core Lucid into a video streamming server running the latests version of clipbucket, all preconfigured and working for you!"

I really like the look of this and have an upcoming use for it. But this patch is quite dated so I thought I'd have a look at it and update it (hopefully). No doubt I'll learn a thing or 2 while I'm at it!

Technically this is a fork although as Adrian doesn't have it hosted on GitHub I have!
